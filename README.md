# Pathfinding Visualizer

This program is a pathfinding vizualizer to help visualize and understand the different pathfinding algorithms and how they work. The application can visualize Dijkstra, A*, Breadth-First and Depth-First search algorithms and combines other elements such as walls and mazes. Try it here: https://ibraheemaloran.github.io/
